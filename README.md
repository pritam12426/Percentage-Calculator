### The function Percentage calculator asks the user for their marks in 5 subjects, calculate the percentage, and prints the result and provide the result in a *Excel* file.
----
* This code is a percentage calculator for students in a specific class and section. It uses the `os` and `playsound` modules to create a folder called "Output" to save the data, and the `plyer` module to send notifications. 

* The user is prompted to input the maximum marks for a single subject, the class number `between 1 and 12`, and the class section `a single alphabetic character`.

* A file named `Class_[class number][class section].csv` is created in the "Output" folder if it doesn't already exist, with the headers `"Name," "English," "Maths," "Hindi," "Sst," "Science," "Total Marks,"` and "Percentage." 
 
* The user is then prompted to input the name of each student, and their marks in each subject. The program calculates the total marks and percentage for each student, and writes this information to the csv file.

* If the student's percentage is 60 or above, a *`pop`* sound is played to indicate success. 

* The program continues to prompt for student names until the user inputs "-." A `notification` is sent to the user when the program is finished, with the file name and location of the saved data.
