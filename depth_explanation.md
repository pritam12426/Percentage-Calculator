# THE IN DEPTH EXPLANATION 
### The program uses several modules such as **os, playsound, and notification** to accomplish its tasks.

* The os module: This module provides a way to interact with the underlying operating system and perform various operations such as creating directories, reading and writing files. In this code, `os.path.exists()` method is used to check if the "Output" directory exists, and if not, os.mkdir() method is used to create it.

* The playsound module: This module allows playing sound files, in the code playsound('Porgram_Data/Error.wav') method is used to play sound when an error occurs, and playsound('Porgram_Data/pop.wav') method is used to play sound when student information is successfully written to the file.

* The notification module: This module allows to show notifications. In the code `notification.notify()` method is used to show notification when the user inputs "exit" to indicate that the file is saved in the output folder.

* The code prompts the user to input the maximum marks for a single subject and uses a while loop to keep prompting until the user inputs a valid number. If an error occurs, the code plays an error sound and shows a message. This is done to ensure that the program uses accurate data for the calculations.

* The code prompts the user to input the class name in numbers and uses a while loop to keep prompting until the user inputs a valid number between 1 and 12. If an error occurs, the code plays an error sound and shows a message. This is done to ensure that the program uses accurate data for the calculations.

* The code prompts the user to input the section of the class and uses a while loop to keep prompting until the user inputs a single alphabetic character. If an error occurs, the code plays an error sound and shows a message. This is done to ensure that the program uses accurate data for the calculations.

* The code creates a file with the name "Class_[Class][Section]" in the "Output" directory using the `os.path.exists()` method to check if the file already exists. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one using the open method and write method.

* The code then prompts the user to input the name of a student and uses a while loop to keep prompting until the user inputs a valid name or "exit".

* If the user inputs "exit", the code shows a notification with message of file saved in output folder and ends the loop.

* If the input is not "exit", the code prompts the user to input marks for various subjects, and uses a while loop to keep prompting until the user inputs a valid number between 0 and the maximum marks for a single subject.

* The code then calculates the total marks and percentage for the student, and writes the information to the file using the open method and write method.

* The code also plays a sound using playsound.play() method when an error occurs or when a student's information is successfully written to the file to give feedback to the user.

### Overall, this code is a program that allows users to input student information and calculates the total marks and percentage for each student, and saves the results to a file. It also includes error handling and feedback mechanisms to ensure that the program runs smoothly and accurately.
